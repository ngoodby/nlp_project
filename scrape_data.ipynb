Sorry for the long thread, science accuracy was probably neglected for the sake of entertainment and the political agenda of the long-fingered bat.  https://t.co/EgG4RTqQsY\n",
      "1451852016481935363 2021-10-23 03:04:29 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> You just need to look at it, so cute and cuddly! And very well-behaved too, at least compared with its cousin the Daubenton‚Äôs bat, which bites far more often and is much nervous! Long-fingered bats are great to work with, they‚Äôre like small sheep!  https://t.co/NNg0ynwwDF\n",
      "1451852009204760579 2021-10-23 03:04:27 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> Also, did you know that the long-fingered bat is the only European bat species with hairy legs? Yes, both males and females! I may be overstepping here but the long-fingered bat could be a feminist icon on the antishaving movement‚Ä¶? Could it be?  https://t.co/ZhFIG3d8mx\n",
      "1451852001533472769 2021-10-23 03:04:25 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> Apart from rivers the long-fingered bat is a cave specialist bat. It needs undisturbed caves both to breed, mate and hibernate, so it is found in karstic areas near large rivers. What better bat to vote this #InternationalYearofCavesandKarst?  https://t.co/wFicTFhjJu\n",
      "1451851992981192709 2021-10-23 03:04:23 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> In a study using radiotracking they found that long-fingered bats positively selected rivers as hunting ground while avoiding artificial water reservoirs, even if they were highly available in the area. A bat with principles! #respect   https://t.co/7yQx4DP3XO  https://t.co/JNKSmubh0J\n",
      "1451851988564680707 2021-10-23 03:04:22 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> Back to the bat, the long-fingered bat feed mainly over calm water so it can detect its prey using echolocation. It is a fluvial species very dependant on well-preserved riverine forests, as it does not hunt in any kind of water body!  https://t.co/ogurWRxelo\n",
      "1451851983137165312 2021-10-23 03:04:21 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> As a side-note, my colleague and friend @estelbo95 has done an amazing job collecting faeces of both long-fingered and Daubenton‚Äôs bat to elucidate and compare the diet of both species using metabarcoding techniques!

      "1451851976963133442 2021-10-23 03:04:20 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> In a study conducted in the Eastern Iberian Peninsula they found that the long-fingered bat feeds mainly on the exotic fish Gambusia holbrooki, which has devastating effects on local fauna. Thank you long-fingered bat for helping us fight invasive fauna!  https://t.co/1yrcwxVGHe\n",
      "1451851974635397125 2021-10-23 03:04:19 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> Another cool thing about the long-fingered bat is that it is one of two European bat species that do not feed entirely on insects as it also catches small fish from the water. I can really relate to a bat that likes fish!  https://t.co/gJxURH4JRo\n",
      "1451851970357125125 2021-10-23 03:04:18 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> By the way, with @Ratpenats_Cat we have a citizen science protocol to study the activity trawling bats in Europe.

      "1451851965063999488 2021-10-23 03:04:17 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> That‚Äôs why the long-fingered bat has such huge feet. The long bristles in its feet help it to have a better grasp of its prey which is consumed directly during flight. Time is gold and the long-fingered bat knows it!  https://t.co/fEcVEe4Nbk\n",
      "1451851957707198470 2021-10-23 03:04:15 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> Actually, the long-fingered bat is what we call a ‚Äútrawling bat‚Äù, bats that fly just above the water, catching their prey from the surface. While they may fall to the water from time to time, the long-fingered bat doesn‚Äôt mind. It loves the risk!  https://t.co/bfKBlMCop7\n",
      "1451851952103600131 2021-10-23 03:04:14 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> The long-fingered bat is part of the genus Myotis, which means ‚Äúmouse-eared‚Äù in Latin by the way. Myotis is one the most speciose mammal genus in the world, with more than 120 species found in almost any corner of the planet. Voting the long-fingered bat is voting for success!  https://t.co/1lhFr93Rld\n",

A cool thing about the long-fingered bat, it is a circum-Mediterranean species, so it probably likes good weather, good food and good vibes!  https://t.co/BkEPwdjCIa\n",
      "1451851936383254529 2021-10-23 03:04:10 -0700 <dlobo_wildlife> As the only bat listed as Vulnerable by the @IUCNRedList in Europe, we only found three confirmed breeding colonies of the long-fingered bat in Catalonia.
